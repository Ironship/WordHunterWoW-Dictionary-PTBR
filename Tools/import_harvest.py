"""Fold text collected in-game back into the quest corpus.

Blizzard's quest API publishes a quest's title and its offer text and nothing
else. There is no objectives field -- it comes back empty for all 30815 quests
in every locale -- and no progress or hand-in text either. NPC gossip is not in
the API at all. So a word that lives only in one of those passages never reaches
the corpus, and therefore never reaches the dictionary: "Besichtigt" is absent
from the German corpus even though "besichtigen" and "Besichtigung" are both in
it, because the imperative only ever appears on an objective line.

The game client has all of it. With text collection switched on
(/whw harvest on) the addon records passages the player actually meets, and
/whw harvest export writes them to SavedVariables as one percent-encoded blob.
This reads that blob and merges it into the corpus.

    python Tools/import_harvest.py --saved "<WoW>/_retail_/WTF/Account/<ACCT>/SavedVariables/WordHunterWoW.lua"

Then rebuild as usual: build_wordlist.py -> translate_google.py -> audit.
